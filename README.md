# Race Day
## Project #23 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
A JavaScript program that registers runners with a race number and gives them instructions on race day. The race number and instructions differ based on the runner's age and whether they registered early.
## What I Learned
  - Control flow statements (if, else if, else)
  - Comparison operators (===)
  - Logical operators (&&)
  - Boolean values
